### Raindrops

<h4>Welcome!</h4>
<p><code>Raindrops.java</code> can be found in this repo at <code>src/main/java/com/sparta/ah</code>.</p>
<p>The unit test class for this project is in <code>src/test/java/com/sparta/ah</code>.</p>


<h4> About </h4>

<p>Raindrops is a class written in Java that contains a single method to return a string depending on a number given as input.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the number has a factor of 3, the method returns <code>'Pling'</code>.</li>
    <li>If the number has a factor of 5, the method returns <code>'Plang'</code>.</li>
    <li>If the method has a factor of 7, the method returns <code>'Plong'</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>28's factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28, so <code>'Plong'</code> is returned.</p>
<p>30's factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, so <code>'PlingPlang'</code> is returned.</p>
<p>34's factors are 1, 2, 17 and 34, so <code>'34'</code> is returned.</p>

### NOTE:
<p>The program uses Java's primitive integer data type, meaning that the program functions correctly for values between -2147483648 and 2147483647 only.</p>

### Tests

<p>The accompanying test files written in jUnit perform thorough unit tests of functionality and boundary values.</p>
